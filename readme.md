## Ephemeris

1. **Download NASA JPL:**
   - Obtain the NASA JPL DE441 Library files `linux_m13000p17000.441` and `header.441` from [NASA JPL FTP](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ftp/eph/planets/Linux/de441/). Set the file paths in the `.env` configuration file.
   
   - Rename `linux_m13000p17000.441` to `linux_m13000p17000.441.bsp` and place it in the `assets/` directory.

## Configuration

1. Duplicate the `env` file and rename it to `.env`.

2. Set the paths for `NASA_JPL_DE441` and `HEADER_441` in the `.env` file.
