# Rust JPL Ephemeris Reader

The Rust JPL Ephemeris Reader is a Rust project designed to read NASA JPL ephemeris data and provide planetary positions based on a given Julian date. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) releases ephemeris data containing accurate positions of celestial bodies, which is crucial for various scientific and engineering applications.

This project utilizes the Rust programming language to create a flexible and efficient tool for extracting planetary positions from the  ephemeris file. The DE441 file is part of the Development Ephemeris (DE) series, and it provides accurate planetary positions for a wide range of dates.
